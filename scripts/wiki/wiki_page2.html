This is not really a 'Hardcore' server, but its not the usually 'noob-friendly' with tons of gear, protected bases and 
safezones.  Here is a list of our server mods, scripts and features.<br><br>
<font color ="#00ff00">
* Blood bags</font>  You can NOT self-bloodbag. You must find a friendly player or NPC to give it to you.  There are also Medics
that can heal your pain.<br><br>
<font color ="#00ff00">
* Epi-pens:</font>
Epinephrine will awake an unconscious player, but you can give this shot to yourself to 'temporarily' increase
your health.  It works like a self-bloodbag but the effects wear off slowly, giving you time to function well enough to get to a medic find help.<br><br>
<font color ="#00ff00">
* Traders:</font>
  Guess what happens when a group of people get together with all kinds of great gear and tell everyone where to find them?  They get KILLED by bandits!  So the trader cities have been ambushed but there is sure to be some special gear that has been overlooked by the bandits.   BEWARE of BANDITS!<br><br>
<font color ="#00ff00">
* Vehicles:</font>
  They are all over the place. But mostly broken, dismantled, out of fuel, flat tires .. BUT if you find a toolbox you can take the parts off of some vehicles to repair another one.  So then vehicles are actually rather common.<br><br>
